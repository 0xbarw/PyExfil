# Exfiltrator Example

Getting a bit more serious now. 
Still very crude and not really usable but getting more functionality. 
It now has data exfiltration over ICMP (not tested!) and over HTTP Cookies. 
Read the open issues on GitHub and come give a hand. A lot more to be done. 

It is inspired by some of the features of [Regi](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/regin-top-tier-espionage-tool-enables-stealthy-surveillance).
